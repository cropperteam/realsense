# Capture and Extract Frames

This folder contains two Python scripts for capturing frames from a RealSense camera and extracting depth information from those frames.

## Contents

- `capture.py`: Captures frames from a live feed using a RealSense camera. Saves the frames in RGB and Depth formats and stores the depth array in a CSV file.
- `extract.py`: Extracts the depth at any pixel point from the CSV file containing depth data and provides the depth value of that point.

## capture.py

This script captures frames from the live feed of a RealSense camera and saves the frames in two formats:
- RGB image
- Depth image

Additionally, it stores a CSV file containing the depth array of the current frame.

### Usage

1. Ensure the Intel RealSense camera is connected to your system.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python capture.py
   ```
3. Press 's' to save the current frame as RGB and Depth images and store the depth data in a CSV file.
4. Press 'q' or 'Esc' to quit the script.

### Dependencies

- pyrealsense2
- numpy
- opencv-python

## extract.py

This script extracts the depth value at any pixel point in the RGB frame. It uses the corresponding CSV file generated by `capture.py` to obtain the depth information.

### Usage

1. Open the script and specify the pixel coordinates (`pixel_x` and `pixel_y`) in the `extract_depth` function call.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python extract.py
   ```

### Dependencies

- numpy
- csv
