# RealSense Camera Frame Capture and Depth Extraction

This repository contains Python scripts for capturing frames from an Intel RealSense camera and extracting depth information from those frames. The scripts are designed to work on Windows systems and are located in the `windows/capture_and_extract_Frames` folder.

## Contents

- `capture.py`: Captures frames from a live feed using a RealSense camera. Saves the frames in RGB and Depth formats and stores the depth array in a CSV file.
- `extract.py`: Extracts the depth at any pixel point from the depth CSV file and provides the depth value of that point.

## Prerequisites

Before using the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Intel RealSense SDK 2.0
- numpy
- opencv-python

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pyrealsense2 numpy opencv-python
```

## Usage

### Capture Frames

The `capture.py` script captures frames from the RealSense camera and saves the following:

- RGB image (`.png` format)
- Depth image (`.png` format)
- CSV file containing the depth array of the current frame

#### Running `capture.py`

1. Connect your Intel RealSense camera to your Windows machine.
2. Navigate to the `windows/capture_and_extract_Frames` folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python capture.py
```

The script will start capturing frames from the live feed and save them in the specified formats.

### Extract Depth

The `extract.py` script extracts the depth at any pixel point from the CSV file containing depth data and provides the depth value of that point.

#### Running `extract.py`

1. Ensure you have the CSV file generated by the `capture.py` script.
2. Navigate to the `windows/capture_and_extract_Frames` folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script with the required arguments:

```bash
python extract.py
```

The script will read the CSV file and output the depth value at the specified pixel coordinates.

### Example Code for `extract.py`

The `extract.py` script uses the following code to extract depth data:

```python
import csv

def get_depth_at_pixel(csv_file_path, cx, cy):
    """
    Get the depth at a specified pixel coordinate (cx, cy) from a CSV file containing depth data.
    
    Args:
        csv_file_path (str): Path to the CSV file containing depth data.
        cx (int): X-coordinate of the pixel.
        cy (int): Y-coordinate of the pixel.
    
    Returns:
        float: Depth value at the specified pixel coordinate.
    """
    with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as csv_file:
        reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
        depth_data = list(reader)
    
    depth_value = float(depth_data[cy][cx])
    
    return depth_value

csv_file_path = "csv/depth_data9.csv"  # Path to your CSV file
cx = 412 # Example pixel x-coordinate
cy = 209  # Example pixel y-coordinate

depth_value = get_depth_at_pixel(csv_file_path, cx, cy)
print(f"Depth value at pixel ({cx}, {cy}): {depth_value}")
```

This script reads the depth data from the specified CSV file and retrieves the depth value at the given pixel coordinates.

## Folder Structure

The expected folder structure for the scripts is as follows:

```
windows/capture_and_extract_Frames/
├── capture.py
├── extract.py
└── output/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── frame_rgb.png
    │   └── frame_depth.png
    └── depth_data/
        └── frame_depth.csv
```

- `capture.py` will save the RGB and Depth images in the `output/images/` folder and the depth array CSV in the `output/depth_data/` folder.
- `extract.py` will read the depth CSV file from the specified path.

This README provides comprehensive instructions and details about the usage of both `capture.py` and `extract.py` scripts, along with the folder structure and example usage.




Certainly! Here's a detailed summary for the installation guide, along with instructions on how to integrate it into your repository's README file.

### Summary for Installation Guide

### Installation Guide for Librealsense on Jetson Devices

This guide provides instructions to install Intel's librealsense on NVIDIA Jetson devices using scripts from the [JetsonHacksNano repository](https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installLibrealsense).

#### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit
- Internet connection

#### Installation Options

There are two primary ways to install librealsense:

1. **Install from Intel Librealsense Debian Repository**:
    - This method does not require patching the kernel or modules.
    - Run the following command to install:
      ```bash
      ./installLibrealsense.sh
      ```

2. **Build Librealsense from Source**:
    - This method is useful if you need to compile from source.
    - Run the following command to build:
      ```bash
      ./buildLibrealsense.sh [ -v | --version <version> ] [ -j | -jobs <number of jobs> ] [ -n | --no_cuda ]
      ```
    - Options:
      - `<version>`: Specify the version of librealsense (e.g., v2.49.0).
      - `<number of jobs>`: Specify the number of jobs to run concurrently when building. Defaults to 1 if the Jetson has ≤ 4GB memory.
      - `<no_cuda>`: Compile without CUDA support. Defaults to using CUDA.

#### Notes

- The current recommendation from Intel is to use UVC for video input on Jetson devices.
- If using `realsense-ros`, ensure the versions of librealsense and realsense-ros are compatible.
- Refer to the [installation_jetson.md](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation_jetson.md) for more advanced configurations and communication interfaces.
